            <h2>Enforcing minimum widths for consistency</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes you don't have the same amount
                of content inside of a set of buttons.
                This isn't always a bad thing, but it can
                start to make your design look inconsistent,
                which will make you look very amateurish.
            </p>
            <p>
                To fix this, we can apply the min-width 
                property to enforce a minimum width for 
                all buttons, along with the text-align 
                property to ensure our button content 
                stays centered.
            </p>
            <p>
                See how even with buttons styled completely
                differently, they somehow look neater with 
                the same widths?  That's the power of a 
                well-planned and consistent design!

            <h2>Wide Buttons</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes you'll want your buttons to
                completely fill the containers they're
                inside of.
            </p>
            <p>
                To accomplish this, we can use a different
                display property value: block.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, block elements take up an entire
                line all on their own.  Since that's exactly
                what we want our buttons to do, it's a 
                simple but effective way to transform our
                button styles! (Just remember that you'll
                also probably want to apply text-align,
                to make sure your button content is centered.)
