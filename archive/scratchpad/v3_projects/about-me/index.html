                <h3>A few words about me</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm an aspiring web designer currently residing
                    near Orlando, Florida.
                </p>
                <p>  
                    I've been classically 
                    trained in the more "analog" arts of drawing and 
                    painting, and I'm currently enrolled in the 
                    F.I.R.S.T. Institute's Graphic Design 
                    and Web Development program in order to 
                    bring my more traditional skillset to the digital world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of studying, painting, and drawing,
                    I also enjoy any media with a good story, 
                    whether that story is found in a film, book, or 
                    video game. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm always up to chat about a good story or
                    interesting piece of artwork, so check out
