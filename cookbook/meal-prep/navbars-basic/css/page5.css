    Another very common style of navbar involves
    having a call-to-action (CTA) button (or buttons)
    at the far right of the navbar.

    Why a button? Well, buttons tend to stand out 
    more than hyperlinks, and also have more space 
    to click on, which is good for a CTA.

    Why to the far right? Remember that we read
    left-to-right, and that we tend to assign
    more importance to the first thing we see,
    which is usually the logo or brand name.

    Then you see the hyperlinks that allow
    you to navigate the site, and then the last
    thing you see is the CTA button(s).  
    
    It's not that the buttons are the least 
    important (in fact, CTAs are usually very 
    important to a site), but think of the
    position as more of a funnel at the end
    of a flow.

    Once you've perused the sight navigation,
    the last thing you see is something telling
    to sign up, or create an account, or 
    something like that.  It's hard to avoid,
    and so, the last thing you see is in some
    ways just as important as the first thing
    you see, just in a different way.

    Anyway, let's get our button in the HTML;
    we're going to need to assign a new id
    to the last anchor so that we can style 
    it on its own
