    Normally, we'd want to add some padding and/or
    margin to our layout, potentially with borders
    as well.  Also, while the background colors are 
    helpful for distinguishing the two columns, 
    they aren't too aesthetically pleasing.

    So we've made a few stylistic adjustments to the 
    sidebar to represent a more common layout design
    (although it is still relatively boring), along
    with a couple tweaks to the main content as well.
