    <h1>It's Critique Time!</h1>
    <h2>Here are some ground rules for critiques in this class</h2>
    <h3>FOR THOSE RECEIVING CRITIQUES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Assume good intent</li>
      <li>Remember that your work is distinct from you</li>
      <li>A criticism against your work is not an attack on you</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>FOR THOSE GIVING CRITIQUES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Be kind, and be helpful</li>
      <li>Be as objective as possible, and focus on the Elements and Principles of Design</li>
      <li>Provide at least one positive piece of feedback, <br>and one suggestion for how to make it better</li>
      <li>Be SPECIFIC in your feedback: specify the page, the location, the text, etc. that you're referring to</li>
      <li>Be sure to include the WHY behind your comments: why do you think something looks good? why do you think your suggestion could make it better?</li>
    </ul>
