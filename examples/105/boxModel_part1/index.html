<body>
    <div>
        This is a div representing the box model
        <br>
        with margin, border, and padding.
        <br>
        This is the content of the div.
    </div>
    <div>
        This is another div.
        <br>
        See how it has the same styles as the first?
        <br>
        And we didn't even have to write anymore more CSS!
        <br>
        But what if we want a div to have a different style?
    </div>
    <div class="myFirstClass">
        This is a div with a class attribute set on it.
        <br>
        It has the value "myFirstClass".
        <br>
        It has a different style we created in CSS,
        <br>
        but still inherits
    </div>
    <div class="myFirstClass">
        This div also has the "myFirstClass" class on it.
        <br>
        See how we were able to share the same style 
        <br>
        across multiple divs?
    </div>
    <div id="myFirstId">
        This div has another attribute called an id on it.
        <br>
        It has the value "myFirstId".
        <br>
        The id attribute is like the class attribute,
        <br>
        but an id value is supposed to be unique,
        <br>
        and should only be used once,
        <br>
        while class values can be reused as much as you want.
    </div>
    <div id="anotherId" class="myFirstClass">
        This is a div with another id value called "anotherId". 
        <br>
        But it also has the class value "myFirstClass" on it.
        <br>
        Id and class attributes can be used together!
        <br>
        Just try to avoid writing CSS rules with conflicting CSS properties.
        <br>
        It can make things confusing when you're just starting out.
