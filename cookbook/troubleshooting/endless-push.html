            <h2>My push never seems to finish!</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                For some students, GitHub Desktop seems to choke when 
                you push your commits, meaning that the "Push to origin" 
                arrows seem to just spin forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                This seems to occur most frequently with students who 
                have low upload speeds 
                when they try to upload large images or a lot of images 
                in their commit (although this isn't always the case).
                Regardless of the reason, there is a tried and true method 
                to get your changes through.
            </p>
            <p>
                Follow the instructions below if your push never seems to 
                be taking forever (and consider ALWAYS using the steps 
                below when pushing in the future, to save yourself time 
                and stress).

                                First, quit GitHub Desktop.
                            </p>

                                shut down the app.

                                You may need to Force-quit the app if

                            <p>
                                Then, open GitHub Desktop again; it shouldn't be pushing anymore.

                                GitHub Desktop is probably in the Changes tab by default;
                                click on the History tab to switch over to that view.
                            </p>

                                In the History view, you'll see a list of all the commits 
                                you've ever made, with the most recent at the top.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The commit you were unable to push should have a little 
                                arrow next to it; this means that this commit hasn't been 
                                pushed yet.
                            </p>

                                will need for viewing the live renders of our code.
