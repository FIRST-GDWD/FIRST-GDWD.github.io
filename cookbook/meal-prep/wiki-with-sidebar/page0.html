                    <span class="bold">Final Fantasy XIV</span> 
                    is a massively multiplayer online 
                    role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by 
                    Square Enix. Directed and produced by Naoki Yoshida 
                    and released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Windows 
                    in August 2013, it replaced the failed 2010 version, 
                    with subsequent support for PlayStation 4, OS X, 
                    PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and Series S. 
                    Final Fantasy XIV is set in the fantasy region of 
                    Eorzea, five years after the devastating Seventh 
                    Umbral Calamity which ended the original version. 
                    In the Calamity, the Elder Primal Bahamut escaped 
                    from his prison, an ancient space station called 
                    Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse across Eorzea. 
                    Through temporal magic, the player character of 
                    the original version escaped, reappearing at the 
                    start of A Realm Reborn. As Eorzea cements its 
                    recovery, the player must fend off a reignited 
                    invasion from the Garlean Empire.

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG, featuring a persistent 
                    world where players can interact with each other and 
                    the environment. Players create and customize their 
                    characters for use in the game, including name, race, 
                    gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in 
                    the original release, players may only choose to be a 
                    Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples 
                    of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. 
                    Players must also select a game server for each 
                    character. While all supported languages are available 
                    on every server, data centers are located in specific 
                    regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan, and Oceania) 
                    to reduce latency between client and server, and players 
                    are advised to choose a server in their region.[3] 
                    Regardless of server or language, players can use a 
                    large library of automatically translated game terms 
                    and general phrases, allowing players who speak different 
                    languages to communicate.[4]

                        <p>
                            PC and home console versions use a unified user 
                            interface and control scheme. Any combination of a 
                            keyboard, mouse, and game controller may be used; 
                            for console players, wireless or USB keyboard and 
                            mouse are required for the former. On PC and macOS, 
                            the game defaults to drag and drop windows, while 
                            on PlayStation and Xbox versions of XIV, the 
                            default interface resembles that console's 
                            XrossMediaBar. This bar is used to access all 
                            menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. 
                            The head-up display for both versions includes a 
                            message log, party status menu, mini-map, and 
                            action bar. The UI offers extensive customization 
                            options.

                            Actions and battle commands differ between PC, 
                            macOS and console versions. The PC and macOS 
                            versions supports both point and click and keyboard
                            input for commands or macros.

                <h4>Character Progression</h4>
                <p>
                    Players improve their characters by gaining experience 
                    points (EXP) and acquiring stronger equipment. After 
                    gaining enough XP, the character will "level up," 
                    improving their statistics, enhancing the character's 
                    performance and often learning new actions. Primary 
                    sources of experience points in Final Fantasy XIV include 
                    completing quests, exploring instanced dungeons, 
                    participating in Full Active Time Events (FATEs), and 
                    slaying monsters in the world.[7] Quests, including the 
                    "main scenario" questline, are generally short, specific 
                    tasks given to the player by non-player characters 
                    which reward items and EXP. Completing main scenario 
                    quests progresses the overarching plot of the game. 
                    Some quests are repeatable, either "daily" quests 
                    repeatable each day, or "Levequests," which consume 
                    "leve allowances" that the player slowly accrues over 
                    time. Dungeons often require multiple players to form a 
                    party to enter, but the Duty Support system enables the 
                    player to play certain dungeons alone, supported by 
                    computer-controlled party members. Some dungeons are 
                    for lower-leveled players to gain EXP quickly while 
                    others are for experienced players to collect rare items,
                     equipment, and currency.[8] The Duty Roulette system 
                     randomly assigns the player to an accessible dungeon, 
                     and once per day, awards additional bonus EXP scaled 
                     to character level on completion.[9] FATEs permit large 
                     groups of players, whether or not they are in a party, 
                     to participate in a shared task in the world. These 
                     location-specific events include battles with notorious 
                     monsters, defending locations, escorting non-player 
                     characters, culling wildlife, and assaulting enemy 
                     fortresses, among other types.[8] Finally, each enemy 
                     the player kills provides EXP, with further EXP available 
                     from the Hunting Log, for killing a fixed amount of 
                     specific creatures. At maximum level, character 
                     progression focuses entirely on acquring stronger 
                     equipment, raising the character's "item level." 
                     This equipment can be gained through a variety of sources 
                     including endgame dungeons, crafting, raids, primal 
                     battles, and elite mark hunts.[10]

                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is set on Hydaelyn, a fictional world of 
                    diverse environments across three main continents, 
                    focused on the region of Eorzea.[22] Four major 
                    city-states are featured: Gridania, in the heavily-forested 
                    Black Shroud; Ul'dah, a trade-centric sultanate in arid 
                    Thanalan; Limsa Lominsa, a thalassocracy found on the 
                    island of Vylbrand; and Ishgard, an isolationist 
                    theocracy in snowy, mountainous Coerthas. Eastward, a 
                    land bridge connects eastern Eorzea to the other main 
                    continents, conquered by the Garlean Empire. Other 
                    cultures include the various endemic tribes, such as 
                    Sylphs and Kobolds; scholarly Sharlayan, which 
                    practices strict nonintervention; and Ala Mhigo, the 
                    easternmost city-state of Eorzea, conquered twenty 
                    years prior by the Garlean Empire.[23] In the face of 
                    the Garlean invasion, Ishgard withdrew from the Eorzean 
                    Alliance, leaving the Alliance nearly defunct. Resisting
                    Garlean assaults has left the once-vibrant central 
                    territory of Mor Dhona a desolate wasteland.[24]
