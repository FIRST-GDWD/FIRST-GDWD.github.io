        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            It's getting late, so you decide to enter the cave and hunker 
            down for the night.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, it seems you'll be staying here longer than you 
            intended, because this cave is home to an enormous bear who was
            just getting ready to hibernate, and you look like a delicious
            snack before it heads off to bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bear effortlessly gobbles you up, and after being deposited
            unceremoniously in its stomach, you find
            yourself questioning some of your life choices 
            as you face...
        </p>
        
        <h2>THE END</h2>
