            <h4>Basic Code Snippets</h4>
            <code>font-weight: normal;</code>
            <br>
            <code>font-weight: bold;</code>
            <br>
            <code>font-weight: 600;</code>
        </div>
        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p class="not-bold">
            There are many different font properties in CSS,
            some of which can do the same things stylistically
            as some of the HTML elements we've learned.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            The font-weight property allows us to make text bold 
            (or not).
        </p>
        <p class="bolder"> 
            font-weight can accept keyword values like "bold", 
            "bolder", "lighter", or "normal", but it can also 
            accept numerical values starting at 100, and 
            incrementing in hundreds up to 900.
        </p>
        <p class="bolder-still">
            Whether these values work as we might expect depend 
            entirely on the font, however.  If your font 
            doesn't support a font-weight value of 900, it
            will default to whatever the closest font-weight is
            that the font does support.
        </p>
        <p class="lighter">
            The font-weight property does the same thing 
            as the &lt;b&gt; element in most browsers,
            but the meaning of that element has changed 
            over the years, and it is now preferable to 
            use font-weight in CSS over &lt;b&gt; in HTML.
