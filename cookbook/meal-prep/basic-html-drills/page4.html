                You will likely need a full 5 minutes for this drill.

                It's not that complicated of a solution, basically
                just wrapping content in headings and <sub> or <sup>
                elements, but the code can get messy rather quickly,
                which may trip you up.
                
                I've reformatted the solution here to keep it clean,
                by splitting some of the content across multiple lines.
                You don't necessarily have to have yours exactly the
                same, but consider whether your code is easier or
                harder to read compared to the solution here.
