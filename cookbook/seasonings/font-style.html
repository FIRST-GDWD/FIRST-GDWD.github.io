        <p class="not-italic">
            There are many different font properties in CSS,
            some of which can do the same things stylistically
            as some of the HTML elements we've learned.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
            The font-weight property allows us to make text 
            italicized (or not).
        </p>
        <p class="italic"> 
            font-style can accept keyword values like "normal"
            and "italic", but also a more obscure one called 
            "oblique".
        </p>
        <p class="oblique">
            Whether these values work as we might expect depend 
            entirely on the font, however.  If your font 
            doesn't support a font-style of "oblique", it
            will probably look the same as "italic".
        </p>
        <p>
            The font-style property does the same thing 
            as the &lt;i&gt; element in most browsers,
            but the meaning of that element has changed 
            over the years, and it is now preferable to 
            use font-style in CSS over &lt;i&gt; in HTML.
