    <h1>Pushing a home page up to Github</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>If you haven't already, download and install the Atom text editor (found here: <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://atom.io/</a> ).</li>
        <li>Install HTMLPreview by Harmsk in the packages tab (see the screenshots below for how to do that)<br /><br />First, go to Settings in Atom. This will open a Settings tab.<br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubIndex_0.png" alt="A01_GithubIndex_0.png"  /><br /><br />In the Settings tab, click the Install link in the sidenav.&nbsp; Then in the search box, type "atom-html-preview".&nbsp; The package by "harmsk" should be the first result in the list; click the Install button to install the package in Atom.<br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubIndex_0_1.png" alt="A01_GithubIndex_0_1.png" /><br /><br />This package will allow you to preview your HTML/CSS/Javascript code within Atom.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>In the left sidenav, click the "Add folders" button, and select the repository folder we just cloned earlier.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubIndex_1_1.png" alt="A01_GithubIndex_1_1.png"  /><br /><br /></li>
        <li>If you added the correct folder, you should see a little book icon next to the repository name.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubIndex_1_2.png" alt="A01_GithubIndex_1_2.png" /><br /><br /></li>
        <li>Right-click on the repository in the sidenav, and create a new file called "index.html".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />NOTE: <em>index</em> has a special meaning in most web servers; if you access a folder without specifying a file, the index page will get loaded.&nbsp; What this means for you, is that when you visit your web site URL, index.html will become the home page.</li>
        <li>Copy the code from this file, and paste it into your new index.html file.&nbsp; We're going to create a basic "Hello World!" home page for now.<br /><br />Make sure to save your changes before moving on to the next step; if you have a little blue circle next to the file name, that means it has unsaved changes in it.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Now, jump back to Github Desktop.&nbsp; In the app, you should see the new index.html file you added, along with its contents.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubIndex_3.png" alt="A01_GithubIndex_3.png" /><br /><br />We're going to save a copy of your changes in something called a "commit".&nbsp; A commit is basically a snapshot of the changes you made, which gets added to the repository's source control.&nbsp; This is useful for many reasons; for example, if you make a breaking change to your website, you can revert back to a previous commit (aka snapshot) to make it work again while you try to figure out what went wrong.<br /><br />Add a commit name (required) and description (optional) in the textboxes in the bottom left of the app.&nbsp; Then click the "Commit to main" button to create a commit of your changes.<br /><br />WARNING: Github cannot handle super large files, and adding files greater than 20 MB could cause Github Desktop to choke; it is highly recommended to use compressed files on the web anyway, so if you have high resolution image or video files you'd like to use, talk with your instructor first.&nbsp; You will likely make your school life a lot harder otherwise...<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Next, we are going to do something called a "push".&nbsp; A push is an action that, well, <em>pushes</em> your local commits to the remote server on github.com.<br /><br />There are two places you start a push in Github Desktop, both circled in the screenshot below.&nbsp; (The term <em>origin&nbsp;</em>refers to the repository on the remote server (github.com) that you cloned your local repository from.)<br /><br />Note that each location has an indicator of how many commits you are going to push.&nbsp; That is because it's possible to make multiple commits locally before pushing them.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubIndex_4.png" alt="A01_GithubIndex_4.png" /><br /><br />Go ahead and click either option to push your changes to your website.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>If the push was successful, the top option should change to "Fetch origin".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubIndex_5.png" alt="A01_GithubIndex_5.png" /><br /><br />For reference:<em><br /><br />Fetching</em> is a command to tell Github Desktop to communicate with the remote server repository to see if anything changed since the last time we fetched.&nbsp; <br /><br />If there were any changes (which could happen if you were writing code on multiple computers or with a team of developers who were pushing their own commits), that button would change to "Pull origin", and indicate how many commits that you're missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Pulling&nbsp;</em>is the process of downloading/syncing changes from the remote server repository with your own local repository.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Now go back to the GitHub website, and open up that link from earlier for your brand new website.&nbsp; With a couple minutes of pushing your code, the website should update to display your brand new "Hello World" home page.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubIndex_6.png" alt="A01_GithubIndex_6.png" /><br /><br /></li>
        <li>Congratulations! You just built your first GitHub Pages site.</li>
