                In more comprehensive web style guides, 
                you usually have primary and secondary 
                button styles defined. Frequently, you'll
                see border button styles used as secondary 
                button styles, and background button styles
                used as primary button styles.

            <p>
                Although sometimes, you'll also just see a 
                custom anchor style paired with a button,
                where the anchor functions as the secondary
                style.

                Buttons with hover states
            </h2>
            <p>
                To set up a hover state for a button,
                you'll have to use the :hover pseudo-class.
                What style you choose for the hover state is 
                up to you; as long as there's enough of a
                visual contrast so that the user notices, 
                "Hey, something's different; seems like I 
                can interact with this", then you've probably
                done your job well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't forget that the 
                <a href="../../seasonings/transition.html">
                    transition property
                </a>
                will make your hover state changes much 
                smoother and more professional looking!
                Just make sure you don't set the duration 
                to be too long. A half second should be 
                your max duration for a button transition.

            <h2>
                Gradient Buttons with Click (:active) States
            </h2>
            <p>
                We can use a nifty optical illusion if 
                we use gradients properly on a button. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Picture something rounded, like a ball.
                When light is shining down on it, where
                are the shadows? On the bottom half of the
                ball. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And if we consider that when setting up 
                a gradient, setting lighter tones on the 
                top and darker tones on the bottom, it
                will make the button appear to bulge out,
                as if it had depth and dimension!
            </p>
            <p>
                What's more, we can apply the opposite 
                principle as well.  Imagine the ball
                from the previous example was squishy,
                and you pushed into it with your finger.
                The shadows would now be at the top,
                while the light would be shining down
                on the bottom half, under the indentation
                of your finger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try clicking (or clicking and holding)
                on the button below, and you'll see that 
                it does a passable imitation of that behavior, 
                making it now seem like that button is
                being pushed in, the opposite of bulging out.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was achieved by inverting the gradient
                when the button was in its click state (or
                more accurately, the "active" state, targeted
                by using the :active pseudo-class)!
