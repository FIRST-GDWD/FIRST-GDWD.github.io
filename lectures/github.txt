What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web hosting service
for the source code of software
and web development projects

It both hosts your web code,
and generates a website from it.

The way it hosts your code is through
"repositories".

Remember that repositories are just a
fancy name for folders that use version
control (aka track the history of your code)

sidenote:
    git is a version control system.
    your repository uses git,
    that's why it's called "git hub":
    it's a hub for git repositories

GitHub is part of the Open Source movement.
Most of the code on GitHub is "open source".

Open Source means that code is free to use,
download, modify, and share.
