            Now, we're going to add our last chunk of HTML:
            to build a gallery using CSS Grid.
            
            First, let's create another div. We'll give this
            div a class of "featured", in addition to that
            same "single-column-layout" class from before.
         -->
         <div class="single-column-layout featured">
            <!--
                Then, let's add an h2 followed by one more 
                div with a class of "grid". We're going to 
                create an interesting grid system that starts 
                at 4 columns but turns into less for 
                responsiveness.
            -->
            <h2>Featured Photos</h2>
            <div class="grid">
                <!--
                    Inside of our div with a class of grid, 
                    let's add a paragraph element with an 
                    id of "p1" and put "Some of my favorite 
                    photos" for its content.

                    After the p element, we'll add 3 image 
                    elements, each with an id of img1, img2, 
                    and img3 respectively.

                    We'll add another paragraph element, 
                    this one will have an id of "p2". And 
                    finally, we'll add a img element with an 
                    id of "img4" after.

                    Let's fill in our src and alt attribtues 
                    then we'll head into CSS.
                -->
                <p id="p1">Some of my favorite photos</p>
                <img id="img1" src="images/photo-1.jpg" alt="photo" >
                <img id="img2" src="images/photo-2.jpg" alt="photo">
                <img id="img3" src="images/photo-3.jpg" alt="photo">
                <p id="p2">Photography is fun!</p>
                <img id="img4" src="images/photo-4.jpg" alt="photo">
            </div>
         </div>
    </body>
