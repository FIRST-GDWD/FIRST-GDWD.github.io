        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            It turns out that despite her hideous appearance, your host 
            is quite a nice lady.  Guess you should learn to not judge by
            appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over a hot cup of tea with honey, she tells a tragic tale of how 
            her son was also "chosen" to slay the dragon, and she never saw 
            him again.  She was getting up there in years and had a bad back, 
            and with her son gone, she couldn't
            maintain the yard or the garden anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            After hearing her tale, and knowing that you couldn't return to 
            your farm without evidence of slaying the dragon, you decide to
            stay here and take care of the old woman and her home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, you clear off the vines off the home, pull the weeds 
            from the yard, and help the old woman revitalize her garden.
            You two live together in quiet peaceful days, away from the strife
            of the kingdom, until eventually you reach...
