        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            Who knew that going deeper into the dark forest would be a good 
            idea?  Because not long after, the trees give way to a vast 
            golden plain, leading up to an imposing, craggy mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
            You pass through the plains, the flourishing vegatation giving 
            way to gravel and stone as you get closer to the mountain range.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you reach the base of the mountain near a large cave, 
            you find it is littered with 
            the charred bones of fallen warriors who came before, their armor,
            shields, and weapons discarded on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly, you hear an ear-shattering roar echoing out from the cave.
            Then you see it: a majestic and fearsome dragon striding out from 
            within.  It sniffs the air, and then its eyes lock onto you.
        </p>
        <h2>Choice 3</h2>
        <p>What will you do?</p>
