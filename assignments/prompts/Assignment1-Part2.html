    <h1>Cloning your repository via the Github Desktop app</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>If you haven't already, download and install GitHub Desktop from the following site: <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://desktop.github.com/</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>After installation, log in using your new GitHub account.&nbsp; It will take you briefly back to the browser to confirm your identify; click "Allow" when prompted.&nbsp; You should see some pages in the app like the following: <img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_0_1.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_0_1"  /><br /><br />Here's the page you will see when it redirects you to Github to authenticate yourself.<br /><br />
          <img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_1.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_1.png" /><br /><br />On the Configure Git, select the "Use my Github account name and email address".<br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_1_2.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_1_2.png"  /><br /><br /></li>
        <li>After you've successfully logged in to GitHub Desktop, we are going to "clone" your remote repository to your local machine.&nbsp; What this means is, we are going to pull down and create a copy of the repository from Github.com (the remote location) to your Desktop (the local location).</li>
        <li>Create a new folder on your desktop called "GitHub".</li>
        <li>In GitHub Desktop, click the "Clone a Repository from the Internet" button.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_1_3.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_1_3.png" /><br /><br /></li>
        <li>Select the Repository we just created earlier on Github.com, and select the folder on your Desktop you just created (you may need to add <em>your_username</em>.github.io to the file path afterwards if it doesn't auto-populate it; see the screenshot below).<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_2.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_2.png" /><br /><br /></li>
        <li>After clicking "Clone", Github Desktop will download your repository from the web.&nbsp; After the download, you should see a new folder named after your repository, with a readme file inside it.&nbsp; This means you successfully cloned your repository!</li>
    </ol>
