        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            You approach the hut.  An ominous chill surrounds the area, which
            only seems to increase as you get closer.  The "yard" of the 
            dwelling is completely overgrown with weeds, and what appears to
            be the remains of a garden is filled with unknown and somehow
            malicious-looking plants.  Surely no one lives here anymore, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            You knock on the front door.  It never hurts to be polite, after
            all, just in case somebody actually was home.
            To your surprise, the door slowly creaks open, and a hideous looking 
            old crone of a woman leaning on a sinister looking staff grins at 
            you wickedly.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well well, what have we here?  It's rare to have a guest so far 
            out here in the woods.  Do come in, I'm nothing if not hospitable..."
        </p>
        <h2>Choice 3</h2>
        <p>What will you do?</p>
