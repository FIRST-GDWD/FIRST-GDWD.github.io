            There are several padding related properties
            and values that we can take advantage of. The 
            key thing to remember is that padding is applied 
            INSIDE an element's border, whether that border
            is visible or not.
        </p>
        <div class="padding-one-value">
            <div>
                <p>
                    This outer div has padding added on all sides,
                    with a border applied to make it easier to
                    see how padding is applied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you provide one value to the padding 
                    property, that value gets applied to all 
                    sides of the element's Box Model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>padding: all-sides;</code> 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="padding-two-values">
            <div>
                <p>
                    This div has padding added on all sides,
                    but with different top/bottom and left/right 
                    values, as well as a border applied to make it 
                    easier to see how padding is applied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you provide two values to the padding 
                    property, the first value gets applied to 
                    the top and bottom of the Box Model, while 
                    the second value is applied to the left and
                    right sides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>padding: top/bottom left/right;
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="padding-three-values">
            <div>
                <p>
                    This div has padding added on all sides,
                    but with different top, left/right, and bottom 
                    values, as well as a border applied to make it 
                    easier to see how padding is applied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you provide three values to the padding 
                    property, the first value gets applied to 
                    the top of the Box Model, the second value 
                    is applied to the left and right sides, and 
                    the third value is applied to the bottom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>padding: top left/right bottom;</code>
