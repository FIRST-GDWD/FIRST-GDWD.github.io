        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, kings often don't take the word "no" very well.
            You are promptly imprisoned, and placed in the stocks to await 
            your fate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sage who told the king that you were the chosen one 
            comes to visit, and you realize that they were your longtime 
            romantic rival for your spouse.  It appears this was all a setup 
            to get back at you for what happened a decade ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            They sneer as they walk away from your cell, and you sit there 
            pondering your choices as you await...
        </p>
        
        <h2>THE END</h2>
