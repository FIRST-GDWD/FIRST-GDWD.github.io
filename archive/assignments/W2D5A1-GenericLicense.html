        <p><strong>HOW TO COMPLETE:</strong></p>
        <p>This project is meant to be the culmination of everything you've learned so far about CSS.&nbsp; It is one of our first forays into layout building, so it may seem a bit intimidating, but by now, you've learned all the tools and features of CSS needed to build such a layout.</p>
        <p>This project is meant to be challenging.&nbsp; You will most likely write a lot of code that doesn't behave the way you want it to the first time; that is okay.&nbsp; Trial and error is part of coding (even when you do it professionally!), and it is also how you learn.&nbsp; Mentally prepare yourself for small failures along the way, so that you can pick yourself up again with a positive attitude and try something else.&nbsp; The only time you truly fail is when you give up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And don't forget, your instructor is here to help you if you get stuck, so don't be afraid to ask for hints or help debugging!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>TIPS</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <ul>
                    <li><span><span><span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;">We STRONGLY recommend that you look over the following "appetizer" for the project</span>, to guide you through the process of how to mentally breakdown the layout into smaller bite-size pieces.</span></span>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://first-gdwd.github.io/cookbook/appetizers/identifying-boxes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifying Layout Boxes</a></li>
                            <li><span style="background-color: #c2e0f4;">This walkthrough practically gives you a visual guide regarding the elements you need to transform and the order to change them in</span>.
                                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                                    <li>You are not required to take this approach, but it will probably be the easiest!</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>As the walkthrough above suggests, <span style="background-color: #c2e0f4;">we recommend you try to tackle the CSS from the outermost containers to the innermost containers</span>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li>Remember that elements that should take up a whole line in their container should be block elements (e.g. &lt;div&gt;), while elements that go side-by-side will likely need to be changed into inline-block elements (with display: inline-block;).</li>
                            <li><span style="background-color: #c2e0f4;">Some elements may also need to be explicitly sized, either with absolute units (e.g. width: 700px;) or relative units (e.g. width: 65%)</span>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                                    <li>Just remember that relatively sized units (e.g. width: 34%) are sized relative to their containers; if their immediate containers aren't sized explicitly, they're going to keep going up the code until they find a container that does have an explicit size.</li>
                                    <li><span style="background-color: #c2e0f4;">Applying a width of 700px to the license itself is a good starting point!</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span style="background-color: #c2e0f4;">Pro-tip: if you struggle with knowing whether you're targeting the correct element in CSS or not, start by adding a border to it</span>.&nbsp; If that border contains the elements you expect, you probably targeted it correctly!&nbsp; Just remember to remove the border when you're done styling (unless you want to have a border).
                        <ul>
                            <li><span style="background-color: #c2e0f4;">In fact, for this project, you may want to start by creating borders that match the images in the "Identifying Layout Boxes" walkthrough</span> above, just to make sure you're targeting the correct elements before trying to get them side-by-side</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The HTML code utilizes the Font Awesome Icon library.&nbsp; If you'd like to view a refresher on how to use that, either to add additional icons or just for the sake of refreshing your memory, check out the tutorial below:
                        <ul>

            <h4><strong>CHALLENGE</strong></h4>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>GOOGLE FONTS</strong></p>
            <p>You may have noticed that the text for the signature in the license screenshot looks different from any of the generic font families we learned about before.&nbsp; That's because it isn't using a generic font family!</p>
            <p>Instead, we're taking advantage of a service offered by Google called Google Fonts, which allows you to use any fonts from their library and practically guarantee that they will work for anyone viewing your web page!&nbsp; This is huge from a design perspective, as making sure our designs look the same on different operating systems and browsers can be quite challenging, so anything that ensures uniformity regardless of the viewer's machine is a big win for us.</p>
            <p>To learn how to use Google Fonts in a web page, check out the tutorial below:</p>
            <p><a href="https://first-gdwd.github.io/cookbook/appetizers/utilizing-google-fonts.html">Google Fonts Tutorial</a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>LINEAR-GRADIENT</strong></p>
            <p>You may have also noticed that the background for the license is not just a single color; in fact, it seems to be made of multiple colors, smoothly transitioned from one to another.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This is done by setting the background to use a special CSS function called "linear-gradient".&nbsp; To learn more about how to use this, check out the documentation below!</p>
