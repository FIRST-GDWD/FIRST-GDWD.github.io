            This paragraph has its background-color set to
            light pink via the hexadecimal value 
            <code>#FFCCCC</code>,
            <span class="highlighter">
                but this text inside has its own background-color 
                set using the color name "yellow" via the CSS Rule
                with the Class Selector targeting the span element.
            </span>
            However, the background-color of the web page's body 
            element is set to the color name "lavender" via an 
            HTML Element Selector.
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>
                All paragraphs inside of a div have their 
                background-color property set to the color 
                "green".
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice that the background-color only fills
                up to where the border of the element is
                (remember the different parts of the Box Model!).
            </p>
            <p id="extra-padding">
                To make elements look more aesthetically pleasing,
                we usually want to add padding to an element with
                a background-color, in order to give the content 
                inside some breathing room, 
                <span class="highlighter">
                    unless we're going for a "highlighter" 
                    type of effect like on this text.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p id="extra-margin">
                Also notice that adding margin does not 
                increase the area of the background-color
                around the text; only padding does that.
            </p>
