        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

        <h3>PREPARE APPLE FILLING:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>
                Add the cubed apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of 
                salt. Cook until the apples soften, about 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the vanilla extract, lemon juice, cornstarch, and 
                water. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens, about 
                2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and let the apple mixture cool.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>PREPARE CHEESE FILLING:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a bowl, mix the softened cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk, 
                and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>ASSEMBLE DANISHES:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Roll out the puff pastry sheets on a floured surface and cut 
                each sheet into circles using a large cookie cutter or a glass.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a smaller cutter, lightly score a smaller circle about 
                3/4 of the way through the dough in the center of each larger 
                circle. This will help keep the center from rising too much 
                during baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese filling into the 
                center of each scored circle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the cream cheese mixture with a spoonful of the cooled 
                apple filling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk the egg and milk together in a small bowl. Brush the 
                outer edges of the pastry with the egg wash.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle a little granulated sugar over the edges.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>BAKE THE DANISHES:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the danishes for 15-20 minutes or until the puff pastry 
                is golden and flaky.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>THE ICING:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, 
                vanilla extract, and milk or cream until smooth. Adjust the 
                consistency with more milk if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the danishes are out of the oven and fully cooled, 
                drizzle the icing over them and enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
