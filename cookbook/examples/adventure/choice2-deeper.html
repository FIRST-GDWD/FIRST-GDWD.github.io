        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            Who knew that going deeper into the dark forest would be a good 
            idea?  Because not long after, the trees give way to a vast 
            golden plain, leading up to an intimidating craggy mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
            You pass through the plains, the flourishing vegatation giving 
            way to gravel and stone as you get closer to the mountain range.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you reach the base of the mountain, you find it is littered with 
            the charred bones of fallen warriors who came before, their armor,
            shields, and weapons discarded on the ground.
        </p>
