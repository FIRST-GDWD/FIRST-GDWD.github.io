            An image (img) element requires the source (src) attribute in 
            order to display anything. The src attribute provides instructions
            to the computer for where to find the image you want to load.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assuming your images are in an "images" folder adjacent to the 
            HTML file you're adding the images to, the value you specify to 
            src will look something like this: src="images/image-file-name.jpg"
            This tells the img element to first look inside of a nearby "images"
            folder, and then to load up the specified file name inside of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Including the alternate (alt) 
            attribute, which provides an alternate textual description
            of the image, is also good practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Image elements are inline elements, 

            <img src="images/cookbook.jpg" alt="cookbook page" width="250">
            
            meaning they will appear "in line" with any text before 
            and after it, unless you alter their display properties or 
            use line breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that image element code can be written on one line, 
            but you can also be split their attributes across multiple
            lines if the code is too long on one line, like below.
        </p>
        <img
            src="images/vintage-red-plaid-bhg-cookbook.webp"
            alt="old Better Homes and Gardens cookbook"
            width="250"
        >
        <p>
            By default, an image will display at whatever its natural 
            size is, which is usually larger than you want, as is the
            case with the image below.
        </p>
        <img 
            src="images/cookbook-new.jpg"
            alt="new Better Homes and Gardens cookbook"
        >
        <p>
            To address this issue, we can either use CSS to resize
            an image (the preferred approach, once you've learned CSS) 
            or we can use the width or height attributes,
            as was used on the image below.
        </p>
        <img 
            src="images/cookbook-new.jpg"
            alt="new Better Homes and Gardens cookbook"
            width="500"
        >
        <p>
            The width and height attributes accept a number value,
            which represents the width or height in pixels. 
        </p>
        <p>
            WARNING! Be careful not to use both width AND height 
            at the same time, as this will likely distort the image
            rather than resize it, as in the example below.
        </p>
        
        <img 
            src="images/cookbook-new.jpg"
            alt="new Better Homes and Gardens cookbook"
            width="100"
            height="300"
