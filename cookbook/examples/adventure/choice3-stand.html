        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            The dragon glares at you intimidatingly, but after several seconds,
            its gaze grows more inquisitive.  It moves toward you, its massive
            feet causing the ground to quake at its approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its huge head is now right in front of you, and it sniffs you 
            curiously, blasting searing hot air across your body.  It then 
            nudges you, as if wondering if you had fainted in place when it 
            revealed itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            You stagger backwards, regaining your balance, and it seems even 
            more intrigued that you were neither attacking nor running away.
            It seems this dragon is not the mindless beast of destruction that 
            you were led to believe it was.
        </p>
        <p>
            You reach out your hand and stroke the massive muzzle of the 
            creature in front of you.  Though your touch must only be the 
            faintest of sensations to it, it seems to growl happily, 
            nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus begins a marvelous friendship between human and dragon.  
            With a dragon at your side, you have no need to fear any man 
            nor beast, and especially not a pompous power-hungry king.
            And so, you have a long time to wait before you finally reach...
        </p>
