    But, there's a lot of empty space off to the 
    right side.  Sometimes we may want that, but
    what if we want to have the image take up
    as much space as possible, but still not 
    overflowing over the edge of the page?

    Well, then relative units can come to our
    rescue! Watch what happens when we change 
    our width to be 100% instead of 250px...

    Our images are larger, but only large enough
    to fit within the page.  Much nicer!

    But again, sometimes that may be what we want,
    but sometimes it may not be.
    
    Depending on the image aspect ratio, stretching
    the width out to the full page width could result
    in a VERY tall image, especially if it has a 
    portrait orientation.

    So, you need to be very conscious and deliberate
    about how you want images to be displayed on 
    your site.  Believe it or not, getting images to
    look right on your web page at any size, whether
    a wide desktop view or a narrow mobile view, is
    one of the more challenging aspects of web design!
