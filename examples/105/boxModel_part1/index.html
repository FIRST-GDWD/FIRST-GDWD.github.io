    <div>
        This is a div representing the box model
        with margin, border, and padding.
        This is the content of the div.
    </div>
    <div>
        This is another div.
        See how it has the same styles as the first?
        And we didn't even have to write anymore more CSS!
        But what if we want a div to have a different style?
    </div>
    <div class="myFirstClass">
        This is a div with a class attribute set on it.
        It has the value "myFirstClass".
        It has a different style we created in CSS,
        but still inherits the earlier div style too.
    </div>
    <div class="myFirstClass">
        This div also has the "myFirstClass" class on it.
        See how we were able to share the same style 
        across multiple divs?
    </div>
    <div id="myFirstId">
        This div has another attribute called an id on it.
        It has the value "myFirstId".
        The id attribute is like the class attribute,
        but an id value is supposed to be unique,
        and should only be used once,
        while class values can be reused as much as you want.
    </div>
    <div id="anotherId" class="myFirstClass">
        This is a div with another id value called "anotherId". 
        But it also has the class value "myFirstClass" on it.
        Id and class attributes can be used together!
        Just try to avoid writing CSS rules with conflicting CSS properties.
        It can make things confusing when you're just starting out.
