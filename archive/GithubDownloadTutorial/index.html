        <li>
          In order to write code in our class, we are going to download and
          install a widely used editor called Visual Studio Code Editor.
          <br /><br />
          Visit the following link and click the big blue "Download" button on the page:
          <br><br>
          <a
            href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >https://code.visualstudio.com/</a

          <img src="assets/imgs/DownloadVSCode.png" alt="vscodehome.png" />
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Once your software downloads, unzip and drag it to your
          Applications folder, making it easier to find in your launchpad
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/vscodeapp.png" alt="vscodeapp.png" />
        </li>
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <!-- Install Extensions to VS Code -->
        <li>
          Now that we have installed the main code editor we will be utilizing
          throughout class, now we're going to install a few extensions that we
          will need for viewing the live renders of our code
          <br><br>
          <img src="assets/imgs/vsinterface.png" alt="vsinterface.png" srcset="">
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          First, navigate to the left side panel in Visual Studio Code and click
          the icon with the four boxes <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/extensionsblocks.png" alt="extensionssearch.png" />
          <br /><br />
          In the Extensions tab, click in the search bar at the top. Then in the
          search bar, type "live preview". The extension Live Preview by
          Microsoft should be one of the first in the list. Click the Install
          button to install the extension
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/livepreview.png" alt="livepreview.png" />
          <br /><br />
          <em
            >This extension will allow you to preview your HTML/CSS/Javascript
            code within Visual Studio.</em
          >
          <br /><br />
          In the Extensions tab, click in the search bar at the top. Then in the
          search bar, type "live server". The extension Live Server by Ritwick
          Dey should be one of the first in the list. Click the Install button
          to install the extension<br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/liveserver.png" alt="liveserver.png" />

          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Login to your GitHub account. From your home screen, click the green
          "Create repository" button. <br /><br />

          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <!-- Make New Repo -->
        <li>
          Name your new repository:<em>your_username</em>.github.io
          (replacing&nbsp;<em>your_username&nbsp;</em>with your actual username,
          of course) <br /><br />
          <strong>NOTE: This is very important to get right!</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/startrepo.png" alt="startrepo.png" />
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Make sure it is public, and tell GitHub to create a README file as
            well.&nbsp;Then click the green "Create repository" button.
            <br /><br />
            <img src="assets/imgs/createrepowithreadme.png" alt="publicrepo.png" />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Now that you've created the repository, we're going to confirm that
          Github Pages is working correctly.&nbsp; You should be on the
          repository page after creating it, so click on the "Settings" tab in
          the navigation near the top. <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/settings.png" alt="mainrepoarea.png" />
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          From there, click the "Pages" link in the left sidenav. <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/pages.png" alt="githubsettings.png" />
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          You should see the link to your brand new website in the box under GitHub Pages, with a [Visit site] button next to it.
          <br /><br />
          If you don't, make sure that the dropdowns under "Build and deployment" are configured to say "main" and "/ (root)".
          <br><br>
          If they are, and you still don't see [Visit site] button, GitHub may just be being a bit slow to publish; give it another couple minutes and refresh the page later.
          <img
            src="assets/imgs/pagesactive.png"
            alt="githubpageslive.png"
          />
        </li>
        <li>
          If you click on the [Visit site] button, 
          you probably will only see the name of your repository 
          (which is actually the contents of the .readme file).
          That's okay! We'll be adding content later!

        <!-- Download Github Desktop -->
        <li>
          <p>
            Now that we have created our Github account and repository, download and install the GitHub
            Desktop application from the following site:
            <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >https://desktop.github.com/</a
            >
          </p>
          <img src="assets/imgs/githubdesktop.png" alt="githubdesktop.png" />
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          After installation, log in using your new GitHub account. It will take
          you briefly back to the browser to confirm your identify; click
          "Allow" when prompted. You should see some pages in the app like the
          following: <br /><br />
          <img
            src="assets/imgs/githubdesktopsignin.png"
            alt="githubdesktopsignin.png"
          />
          <br /><br />
          Here's the page you will see when it redirects you to Github to
          authenticate yourself.
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/authorization.png" alt="authorization" />
          <br /><br />On the Configure Git, select the "Use my Github account
          name and email address"; you'll probably need to change your email address to the one you entered before. <br /><br />
          <img
            src="assets/imgs/configuregit.png"
            alt="clonerepo.png"
          /><br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          After you've successfully logged in to GitHub Desktop, we are going to
          "clone" your remote repository to your local machine. <br /><br />
          <strong>
            "Cloning" in GitHub is the process of pulling down that repository
            we created earlier from Github.com (the remote location) 
            and creating a copy of it on your computer (the local location).
          </strong>
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          In GitHub Desktop, click the "Clone a Repository from the Internet"
          button. <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/clonerepo.png" alt="clonerepo.png" />
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the Repository we just created earlier on Github.com, and
          the Local path should default to a new Github folder inside your Documents folder.
          <br><br> 
          (you may need to add <em>your_username</em>.github.io to the file path afterwards if it
          doesn't auto-populate it; see the screenshot below).<br /><br />
          <img
            src="assets/imgs/clonetodocuments.png"
            alt="clonerepo2.png"
          /><br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          After clicking "Clone", Github Desktop will download your repository
          from the web.
          <br><br>
          After the download, in your Documents folder, in the Github folder,
          you should see a new folder
          named after your repository, with a readme file inside it. This means
          you successfully cloned your repository! <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Make sure you pay attention to the local path where your project is
          cloned to so you can always find it on your computer!</strong>
          <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, in Github Desktop (Your recently cloned repository should be the current) and Click "Open in Visual Studio" in the middle section
            <br /><br />

    <!-- Part 4 Instructions -->
    <section>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Now that we have a local copy of our Github repository, we can start our Code Skeleton exercise!
        </li>
        <li>
          Take a moment to pause here, and complete that assignment, which involves creating a template "code skeleton", which we will use for almost all
          future coding projects and exercises in the course.
          <br><br>
          <img src="assets/imgs/codeskeleton.png" alt="skeletonvscode.png">
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Don't forget to save! A Circle indicator next to a filename in Visual Studio Code means the file is not saved.
            <br><br>
            The shortcut on Macs to save is CMD + S (when you have the file selected)</strong>
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, jump back to Github Desktop. In the app, you should see the changes to your code_skeleton folder; in this case, only the index.html file.  <br><br>
            (You might wonder why the 'images' and 'css' folders aren't in there. Well, GitHub desktop only tracks changes to files; folders are more or less invisible to it, until a file is put inside of them.)
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/indexhtml.png" alt="revisedindex.png" />
          <br /><br />
          We're going to save a copy of your changes in something called a "commit". <strong>A commit is basically a snapshot of the changes you made, which gets added to the repository's source control.</strong> This is useful for many reasons; for example, if you make a breaking change to your website, you can revert back to a previous commit (aka snapshot) to make it work again while you try to figure out what went wrong.
          <br /><br />
          Add a commit Summary (required) and Description (optional) in the textboxes in the bottom left of the app. Then click the [Commit to <b>main</b>] button to create a commit of your changes.
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/commit.png" alt="commit.png">
          <br /><br />
          <strong>WARNING 1: Github Desktop cannot handle super large files, and adding files greater than 1 MB could cause Github Desktop to choke; it is highly recommended to use compressed files on the web anyway, so if you have high resolution image or video files you'd like to use, talk with your instructor first.&nbsp; You will likely make your school life a lot harder otherwise...</strong>
          <br /><br />
          
        </li>
        <li>Next, we are going to do something called a "push". <strong>A push is an action that, well, <em>pushes</em> your local commits to the remote server on github.com.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          There are two places you start a push in Github Desktop, both circled in the screenshot below. (The term <em>origin&nbsp;</em>refers to the repository on the remote server (github.com) that you cloned your local repository from.)
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Note that each location has an indicator of how many commits you are going to push. That is because it's possible to make multiple commits locally before pushing them.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/pushoptions.png" alt="pushorigin.png" />
          <br /><br />Go ahead and click either option to push your changes to your website.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>WARNING 2: If you have weak or unstable Wifi, it is recommended that you create separate commits for each image you need to push, rather than including all images in a single commit.  
            <br>Github Desktop will sometimes stall if you commit and push all your images at once with weak internet, so save yourself the stress, and commit/push images one at a time.</strong>
          <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>If the push was successful, the top option should change to "Fetch origin".
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/fetchorigin.png" alt="fetchorigin.png" />
          <br /><br />
          For reference:<em>
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Fetching</em> is a command to tell Github Desktop to communicate with the remote server repository to see if anything changed since the last time we fetched.</strong>
            <br /><br />
            If there were any changes (which could happen if you were writing code on multiple computers or with a team of developers who were pushing their own commits), that button would change to "Pull origin", and indicate how many commits that you're missing.
            <br /><br />
            <strong><em>Pulling&nbsp;</em>is the process of downloading/syncing changes from the remote server repository with your own local repository.</strong>
            <br /><br />
         </li>
         <li>Now return to the Github website, and go into the repository you made earlier with github.io at the end of it. Once you navigate to the main repository code screen, you should see your code_skeleton folder that you created in the middle section.
          <br><br>
          <strong>NOTE: Github pages often times takes 5-10 minutes to actually render out your commit, so you may have to wait and then check to see if your site is live </strong>
          <br><br>
            Now you can navigate to the sidebar and click on github pages under "Environments". 
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/environments.png" alt="githubsidebar.png" />
          <br /><br />
          From there you will find the deployment page (the most recent deployment will usually be at the top). Click on the deployment and it will open your "homepage" of sorts (still just the name of your repository, in your .readme file). 
          <br><br>
          In order to find your code_skeleton site (a project nested in your main repository), you must add the project folder name to the end of the URL (and it must match EXACTLY! No differences in case or spacing or spelling)
          <br /><br /> 
          For example:
          <br>
          https://gdwd-kc.github.io/kctobias.github.io<strong>/code_skeleton/</strong>
          <br><br>
          <strong>Don't forget the last forward slash!</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Granted, your code_skeleton project folder will only display an empty page, with the name of "Document" on the tab. Here's an example of what your next exercise will look like when it's loaded up in the browser.
          <br><br>
          <img src="assets/imgs/browser.png" alt="browser.png" />
          <br /><br />
          Within a couple minutes of pushing your code, the url should update to display your brand new "Hello World" homepage! 
          <br><br>
          <strong>Congratulations! You just built your first GitHub Pages site.</strong>
