        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            Well, that wasn't the brightest choice to make.  The swords and 
            shields of the barbequed knights that came before you didn't help 
            them much; why did you think they'd help you?
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you can even take a few steps, the dragon opens its 
            maw and breathes out a horrifying blast of fire that incinerates 
            you in seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, at least you weren't the only one here who met...
        </p>
        
        <h2>THE END</h2>
