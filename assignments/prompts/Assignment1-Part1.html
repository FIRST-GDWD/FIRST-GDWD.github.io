    <h4>Assignment 1 Part 1</h4>
    <h1>Create your GitHub Pages website</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/</a> and create a GitHub account.&nbsp; <br /><br />NOTE: Your username will be publicly viewable, and will also be included in the URL for your website, so make sure to pick something you're comfortable sharing with the world!<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Login to your GitHub account.&nbsp; From your home screen, click the green "Create repository" button in the left section.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_1.png" alt="A01_Github_1.png" /><br /><br /></li>
        <li>Name your new repository:&nbsp;<em>your_username</em>.github.io&nbsp; (replacing&nbsp;<em>your_username&nbsp;</em>with your actual username, of course)<br /><br />NOTE: This is very important to get right!&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_2_1.png" alt="A01_Github_2_1.png" /><br /><br />
            <p>Make sure it is public, and tell GitHub to create a README file as well.&nbsp; Then click the green "Create repository" button.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_2_2.png" alt="A01_Github_2_2.png" /></p>
        </li>
        <li>Now that you've created the repository, we're going to confirm that Github Pages is working correctly.&nbsp; You should be on the repository page after creating it, so click on the "Settings" tab in the navigation near the top.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_3.png" alt="A01_Github_3.png" /><br /><br /></li>
        <li>From there, click the "Pages" link in the left sidenav.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_4.png" alt="A01_Github_4.png" /><br /><br /></li>
        <li>You should see the link to your brand new website in the green box.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_5.png" alt="A01_Github_5.png" /><br /><br />Congrats!&nbsp; You've created your first website (it's just very empty at the moment).</li>
    </ol>
