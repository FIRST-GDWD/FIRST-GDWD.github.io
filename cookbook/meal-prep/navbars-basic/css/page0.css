/*
    This demo is going to be a bit more dynamic
    than usual; we're going to be modifying 
    things quite a bit, showcasing different
    designs that could be applied to a navbar,
    as opposed to building multiple navbars.

    This will probably be confusing to some
    students, but reassure them at the start
    that the different navbars we'll be 
    building are also covered in the Layouts
    section of the Coding Cookbook.

    To start out, we'll use a pretty basic
    HTML structure of a div with anchors 
    inside.

    (I think this may contradict something we
    had in a previous powerpoint, where we
    said we'd be teaching them to put 
    navigation links in lists.

    But in the interesting of keeping things
    simpler, I'm opting to keep lists out
    of the demo)
