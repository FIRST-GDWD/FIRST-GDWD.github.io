        The anchor element (also known as links or hyperlinks) can be used 
        to navigate the user to a different location on the current page,
        or to a different page entirely, as in the example below.

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">
            Click me to visit Google's home page
        </a>
    </p>

        To use anchor elements, you will need to provide an hyperlink 
        reference (href) attribute.  If you want to link to a different 
        page, you can just provide the URL you want to link to (although,
        if you're navigating a user off of your site, it is generally 
        good practice to open that page in another tab.  You can do so 
        by including this attribute name and value: target="_blank")

        By default, anchor elements are inline elements, meaning they will
        appear "in line" with other text around them.  So if we add three 
        anchor elements right here:
