        <div id="container-1">
            <p>
                This div has a border set on it, with the 
                border's width, style, and color all set at 
                once.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has a rather thick 10px border-width, a 
                "solid" border-style, and a border-color of 
                "coral".
            </p>
            <p>
                However, as we'll see below, we can also 
                target different parts of the border individually,
                and we can even target individual sides as well.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="container-2">
            <p>
                This div sets its border properties individually.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has a thinner 5px border-width, a 
                "dashed" border-style, and a border-color with a 
                hexadecimal value of <code>#8888FF</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also gave it a little margin and padding. The 
                margin gives it space OUTSIDE the border on the 
                top and bottom, but not on the sides. The padding 
                give it space equally on all sides INSIDE the 
                border.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extra space on the inside is beneficial for 
                giving the inside content room to breathe, and 
                the extra space on the outside is good for
                separating the div from the content around it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="container-3">
            <p>
                This div looks a little wacky, just because we're
                showing how you can target individual sides at once,
                or even individual properties on a specific side.
            </p>
            <p class="pretty-in-pink">
                Just to be clear, borders can be added to any 
                HTML element, not only div elements.  But we tend 
                to use borders more on elements used as containers, 
                in order to group related content, and separate it 
                from unrelated content.
