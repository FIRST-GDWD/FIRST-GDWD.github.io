            That should get our image loaded, but we still may 
            struggle with the size issue. If so, we can adjust
            it with the width attribute again; OR, we could also
            use the height attribute for similar effect.

            However, I don't recommend using both width and
            height together; that could modify the image's
            aspect ratio, causing it to squash or stretch.

            Also, don't forget to add the alt attribute as well.

            That wraps up this demo!

            Rememeber what you learned about HTML Attributes:

            - attributes only live inside the opening tag of
            an HTML element

            - HTML attributes are composed of three main parts:
                - the attribute name
                - the assignment operator (=)
                - the attribute value (wrapped in double quotes "")

            - you can have multiple attributes in the same element

            - if multiple attributes don't fit on one line,
            you can break the tag and attributes onto separate lines
            with the attributes indented, similar to how we should
            indent children within their parents
