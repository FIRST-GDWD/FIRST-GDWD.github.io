        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            You head out unprepared into the dark forest south of the kingdom.
            You have no battle experience and no clue where you're going, but 
            that's okay, because you're the chosen one, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            As you walk deeper into the forest, it becomes darker and darker.
            That shouldn't be a surprise, because it was called the "dark" 
            forest, after all.  You really wish you had a torch or lantern of 
            some kind.  There are sounds coming from the woods all around you,
            seemingly just out of your range of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, you come to a fork in the trail you find yourself
            walking on.  One path leads deeper into the darkness, but you think 
            you may see some light in the distance.  The other leads downhill 
            into what looks like a cave.  Also, just off the path, you notice 
            a little hut, nearly blending into the foliage with all the vines 
            growing over it.
        </p>
