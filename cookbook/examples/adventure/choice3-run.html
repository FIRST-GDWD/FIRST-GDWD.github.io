        <h1>The Quest to Slay the Dragon</h1>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            You decide that it was a poor decision to knock on the door, 
            and flee from the hideous old woman and her hut.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this was an equally poor decision.  Didn't anyone ever 
            tell you not to reject a witch's invitation?
        </p>
        <p>
            You hear her cackling loudly behind you.  Suddenly, you trip on a 
            vine on the ground.  Wait, no, you didn't trip. IT tripped YOU.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vines curl around your legs and up your torso, dragging you back 
            towards the garden.  A monstrous carnivorous plant, the source of 
            the vines, unearths itself from the ground, and the last thing you 
            see is its gaping maw open wide as you are dragged towards...
        </p>
        
        <h2>THE END</h2>
