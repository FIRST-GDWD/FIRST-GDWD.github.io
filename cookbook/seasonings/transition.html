        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p>
            The transition property is a very fun CSS Property
            allows you to add simple animations between different
            states of an HTML element.
        </p>
        <h5>A Preface: HTML Element States</h5>
        <p>
            Before we dive into the transition property, we need 
            to talk briefly about a key term from the introduction
            above.
        </p>
        <p>
            What do we mean by "different states"? The simplest 
            example would be something like a hover 
            state.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Have you noticed that when you hover over a 
            <a href="" class="no-hover-color">hyperlink</a>
            the cursor changes to a pointer icon?  That is because 
            when the anchor enters the hover state, a CSS Property 
            called "cursor" is changed from its default value to 
            the "pointer" value.
        </p>
        <p>
            How do we define or set up these different states?
            While custom states can be defined using JavaScript,
            the majority of basic HTML Element states can be
            targeted in CSS using something called 
            <b>pseudo-classes</b>.
        </p>

        <h5>Pseudo-classes</h5>
        <p>
            <b>Pseudo-classes</b> are special keywords that can be
            added in CSS selectors to define a CSS Rule targeting 
            an HTML Element in a certain state.
        </p>
        <p>
            They have a bit of a funny syntax using the colon ( : ), 
            but what's one more symbol added to the two selector 
            symbols you already know (the hashtag # and dot .)?
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's use our hover state as an example again. Suppose
            we wanted to change the hover state of ALL anchors on
            a page so that they turn turquoise when you hover over them.  
            In that case, we might use some CSS code like this:
        </p>

        <h4>
            <code>
                a:hover { 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: turquoise;
                <br>
                }
            </code>
        </h4>

        <p>
            That code targets ALL anchors on the page, and 
            tells them to change to the color turquoise on hover.
        </p>

        <p>
            Code like this is critical to using the transition 
            CSS Property.  Animation can only occur if there is 
            a change of some sort on an HTML Element; otherwise,
            what would actually be animated?  And pseudo-classes
            are one of the easiest ways to define different 
            states for HTML Elements to animate through.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are many different pseudo-classes you can use in 
            your CSS code, some more useful than others. However,
            they are not the focus of this entry, so we'll just 
            leave you with some extra additional resources at the 
            bottom of the page if you're interested to learn more.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alright, now let's get into the real meat and potatoes
            of this entry: the transition property.
        </p>

        <h5>The Anatomy of the Transition Property</h5>
        <p>
            The transition property is one of the more complex 
            CSS Properties that you'll be learning about.  It's 
            not too bad once you get the hang of it, but until 
            you do, it'll look kinda weird. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            To use the transition property, you'll need to 
            <b>register</b> other CSS properties with it,
            so that it knows what to animate.
        </p>
        <p>
            To <b>register</b> a CSS Property with the transition 
            property for animation, you'll need to include 
            two things:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The name of the CSS Property</li>
            <li>The duration (in seconds) of the animation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Let's take a look at a basic example, using the same
            objective we used above, changing anchor to turquoise 
            when we hover over them:
        </p>

        <h4>
            <code>
                a { 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transition: color 0.5s;
                <br>
                }
            </code>
        </h4>

        <p>
            Inside there, you can see the two parts we said we 
            needed above: the name of the property we want to 
            animate (the color property) and duration we want 
            the animation to have (0.5s, or in other words, 
            a half second), each separated by a space.
        </p>

        <p class="warning">
            CAVEAT: You can't use just any CSS Property with 
            the transition property. You can only register CSS 
            Properties that are considered "animatable".  Most
            of time, if the property accepts color or number 
            values, then it can be animated.  But more complex 
            properties, like the display property for example,
            are not "animatable", so they will not work if 
            you try to register them with the transition 
            property.
        </p>

        <h5>Simple Example: Animating One CSS Property</h5>
        <p>
            When we bring that code together with the code we 
            wrote earlier, we will have all we need to animate 
            anchors to turquoise on hover!
        </p>

        <div class="example-container">
            <h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
            <h4>
                <code>
                    a { 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transition: color 0.5s;
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br><br>
                    a:hover { 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: turquoise;
                    <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </h4>

            <p>
                <a href="" class="simple-example">
                    <b>Try hovering over this and see!</b>
                </a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            The anchor above take a half second to animate
            smoothly between its normal color in its default
            state and the red color in its hover state. AND,
            it also takes a half second to animate back to
            its default state when you move your cursor off
            of the anchor.
        </p>

        <h5>
            Warning: Be Sure to Set the Transition 
            Property on the Right State!
        </h5>
        <p>
            If you look closely at the example above, you might 
            wonder why we didn't just include the transition 
            property on the hover state.  That seems like it'd 
            be simpler.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, let's try it, and see what happens.  We'll add 
            an extra class and use a different color to separate
            this example from the previous one.
        </p>

        <div class="example-container">
            <h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
            <h4>
                <code>
                    a.bad-example:hover { 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transition: color 0.5s;
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: orange;
                    <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </h4>

            <p>
                <a href="" class="bad-example">
                    <b>Hover on and off me!</b>
                </a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            When you hover over the hyperlink above, all seems 
            well!  It seems like nothing is wrong...until you 
            move your cursor off the anchor. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Did you catch what happens?  It's subtle, but it 
            didn't animate back to its default state: it just 
            instantly snapped back.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's because it's doing exactly what we told it to
            do: we only put the transition property on the hover 
            state, so it will ONLY transition (animate) when we 
            hover over it.  As soon as we move the cursor off of 
            it, there is no transition property set, so it 
            doesn't animate back.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an important part to using the transition 
            property:
        </p>
        <p class="warning">
            <b>
                Set the transition property on the DEFAULT 
                state of your HTML Element, NOT on the state 
                that you're animating to! (in other words, 
                don't set transition property on the 
                pseudo-class selector!)
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are certain exceptions to this rule when 
            you're doing complex animations, but most of the
            time, following this rule will keep your animations
            working properly!
        </p>

        <h5>Advanced Example: Animating Multiple CSS Properties</h5>
        <p>
            In the examples above, all we did was attempt to 
            change the color of a hyperlink.
            But what if we wanted to animate more than one 
            CSS Property?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, we can do that too!  All we need to do is 
            register more properties with the transition
            property.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not that we'd want to actually do this in reality,
            but let's say that we want to animate the color,
            background-color, and font-size when we hover
            over the next paragraph.
        </p>

        <div class="example-container">
            <h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
            <h4>
                <code>
                    p.advanced-example { 
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </h4>

            <p class="advanced-example">
                Hover over me! Hover over me! Hover over me!
                Hover over me! Hover over me! Hover over me!
                Hover over me! Hover over me! Hover over me!

            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            It works! And this highlights a couple of 
            important things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Multiple CSS Properties can be registered 
                with the transition property (just be sure
                to separate them with commas and not
                semicolons!)
            </li>
            <li>
                Anchors are not the only things that can be
                animated or have hover states! Any HTML 
                element can use the transition property,
                and any HTML element can use pseudo-classes
                like :hover
            </li>
            <li>
                Animating the sizing or spacing of HTML 
                elements can affect other elements around
                them.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That last one is important from both a design 
            and a UI/UX perspective.  Notice how when you
            hover over that advanced example paragraph,
            it pushes down everything beneath it?  We 
            usually want to avoid that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Movement of content can be a bit distracting, but 
            it doesn't usually affect too much if things
            grow vertically; however, if things also grow
            horizontally, it can often mess up your 
            design, especially in smaller, more compact 
            parts of your site, like a navbar.
        </p>        
        <p>
            So while it can be fun, just don't go too crazy
            with transitions when it comes to professional
            web design!  Subtlety is usually a better approach.
        </p>
